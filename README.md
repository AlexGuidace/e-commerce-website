# **E-Commerce Website**

# Description
A web application focusing mainly on the backend using Python and Django.

Through this ebay-like app, you can do many of the things an ebay user would be able to do: post items to bid on, view items, bid on items, add and remove items to and from your watchlist, and browse categories for items.

I built this project for [Harvard CS50's Web Course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/), a hands-on course that teaches students how to build websites.
